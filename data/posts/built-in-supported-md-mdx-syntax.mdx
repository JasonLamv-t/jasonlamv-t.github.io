canonicalUrl: build-in-syntax
---

### Basic inline syntax

This Blog was based on **Tailwind Next Blog**, a blog template open source project at [Github](https://github.com/jasonlamv-t/tailwind-next-blog). You can use this template via run `npx degit https://github.com/JasonLamv-t/tailwind-next-blog` in a empty directory to initialize for your own blog.

### Code block

```ts
const hint = 'Basic usage example';
```

#### With title

````md:Code blocks with title
```ts:Code blocks with title
const codeType = 'ts';
const title = 'Code blocks with title';
```
````

#### Show line numbers

````md:Show-line-numbers showLineNumbers
```ts:Show-line-numbers showLineNumbers
const title = 'Code blocks with title';
```
````

#### Show line numbers

````md:Highlight showLineNumbers {2, 4-6}
```ts:Highlight showLineNumbers {2, 4-6}
const navigation = [
  ['Blogs', '/blogs'],
  ['Projects', '/projects'],
  ['About', '/about'],
];
```
````

### Math

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$
